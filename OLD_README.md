# Hello Fellow Traveler ðŸ‘‹

## About Me!

My name is Zbigniew, and I had many

I started my programming adventure in technical middle school (2014), where I learned how to create websites and desktop applications to later became a unicorn programmer ðŸ¦„. After I got my technical degree, I started working at [Landingi](https://github.com/landingi) as a Junior PHP Developer ðŸ¥‡. Then I got promoted to the regular developer, and in 2020 I was made a Tech Lead. In the meantime, I was studying at the [Silesian University of Technology](https://www.polsl.pl/en/) where in 2022, I gained an Engineering degree in Information Technology. Later that year, I joined [Sylius](https://github.com/sylius) - an Open Source eCommerce platform. After some time, I moved my career to the Financial Technology sector at [TransferGo](https://github.com/transfergo)
