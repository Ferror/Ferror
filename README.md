# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

## About Me!

My name is Zbigniew, and I am a PHP programmer & Tech Lead.
I have started my adventure in technical middle school, where I started learning how to write simple websites and C++ applications to become a unicorn programmer. Just after getting my degree, I got a job at Landingi as a Junior PHP Developer. I worked hard, and just after a year, I got a promotion that removed my junior prefix ðŸ¥‡. In 2020 I got promoted to Tech Lead, and at the highest pick, I had lead 6th developers - both frontend and backend. Mostly, juniors and regulars.
