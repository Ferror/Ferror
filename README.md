# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

## About Me!

Hello There! My name is Zbigniew, and I am a PHP programmer & Tech Lead.

I have started my adventure in technical middle school (2014), where I started learning how to write simple websites and C++ applications to later became a unicorn programmer. After I got my technical degree, I started working at Landingi as a Junior PHP Developer. I worked hard, and after a year, I got a promotion that removed my junior prefix ðŸ¥‡. In 2020 I got promoted to Tech Lead, and at the highest pick, I had led 6th developers - both frontend and backend. Mostly, juniors and regulars. In the meantime, I was studying at the Silesian University of Technology wherein in 2022, I gained an Engineering degree in Information Technology.
